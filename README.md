# hydro-bandaid_manufacture
A project proposal on how to manufacture a smart drug delivery device that could deliver the drug controlled based on different conditions. 

This is the a project proposal for class MSE470 (Design and Use of Biomaterials) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Thie project proposed to manufacture a device that could deliver drugs in a smart way. The device could theoretically been useful for melonoma patients and any other skin diesases. The device would deliver higher drug does to more cancerous tissue and lower to less cancerous tissue based on the unique properties of hydrogel.
